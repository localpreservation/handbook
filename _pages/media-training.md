). They also have great resources on [How to pitch](http://www.theopedproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=70&Itemid=82).

1. Lede (Around a news hook)
2. Thesis (Statement of argument – either explicit or implied)
3. Argument: Based on evidence (such as stats, news, reports from credible organizations, expert quotes, scholarship, history, first-hand experience)
  - 1st Point
    - evidence
    - evidence
    - conclusion
  - 2nd Point
    - evidence
    - evidence
    - conclusion
  - 3rd Point
    - evidence
    - evidence
    - conclusion
4. Note: In a simple, declarative op-ed (“policy X is bad; here’s why”) , this may be straightforward. In a more complex commentary, the 3rd point may expand on the bigger picture—historical context, global/geographic picture, mythological underpinnings, etc.—or may offer an explanation for a mystery that underpins the argument– eg., why a bad policy continues, in spite of its failures.
5. “To Be Sure” paragraph (in which you pre-empt your potential critics by acknowledging any flaws in your argument, and address any obvious counter-arguments.)
6. Conclusion (often circling back to your lede)
