# Guide to Project Management for Preservation

We are creating a guide to explain how we are working on the Local Preservation School and as a reference for how preservationists in a variety of contexts manage projects. How do people get started? How do they stay motivated? How do they evaluate their work?

# How do preservationists work?

Preservation takes place in many different contexts:

- All-volunteer groups
- Small nonprofits
- Medium and large nonprofits
- Cultural Resource Management firms
- Architecture, engineering and development firms
- All-volunteer public commissions
- Small public agencies
- Medium and large public agencies

Different contexts require different ways of working and different tools. Some individuals and organizations have no formal strategy for project management but rely on more informal ways of working. Please share how you work as a preservationist and help us improve this guide!
