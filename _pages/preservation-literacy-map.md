# Preservation Literacy Map

## What is the preservation literacy map?

The Preservation Literacy Map is a detailed outline describing competencies, skills and knowledge that people need to have in order to be effective advocates for historic preservation. The Literacy Map can serve as a guide to a broader database of online courses, publications and resources to connect people to the most relevant resources for their area of interest.

The concept of a "literacy map" as a core guiding document for this project is inspired by the Mozilla Webmaker project's [Web Literacy Map](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/web-literacy/). The intent of the Web Literacy Map is to help people "build literacy in exploring, building, and sharing the web" by describing "powers like coding, storytelling, protecting your online privacy" and connecting those skills to related links "hands on projects to make and activities for teaching." As with Mozilla's Web Literacy Map, the Preservation Literacy Map will allow people to determine what skills they have, what skills they lack and how to find resources to improve their confident in those areas.

The literacy map will be co-created by the team of participating facilitators and course instructors, along with contributions and feedback from participants in the online community this project seeks to assemble. Instructors and participants can both use the map to help evaluate the effectiveness of the online courses and resources by articulating how they relate to specific skills. Feedback from participants during the initial pilot course and the launch of the broader national course will shape the content and structure of the literacy map through three versions.

## Timeline

Our plan is to draft the literacy map this fall based on interviews and additional research, then spend the winter and spring working through revisions â€” concurrently with the development of course content and pilot educational activities. We are seeking feedback on course topics on the **[Local Preservation School 101 Trello board](https://trello.com/b/dxqnRFsi/local-preservation-101).**
