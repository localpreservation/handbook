# Guide to Teaching for the Local Preservation School

## What are our values?
_Inspired by the [Teach Like Mozilla Overview](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/)_

- We are a community of educators, learners, mentors and teachers. We are professionals, volunteers and scholars. We are activists and public employees.
- We teach preservation in a way that focuses on the essential interdisciplinary character of our practice including history, architecture, communiy development, archaeology, anthropology, urban planning and design, folklore, historic site management, and more.
- We are dedicated to empowering others so they can make a difference in preserving and revitalizing historic places in their own communities.
- We teach and learn by making things together and openly reflecting on the process of learning and doing preservation in an inclusive and locally-relevant environment.
